<p>chess client using chess.js and chessboard.js and uses PHP/MySql.<br>This application is intended to be loaded onto a server for a private game database.
</p><p>
This application is intended to be a private chess client (no logins are required) for playing slow games of chess. Though I'm thinking of adding a simply authentication/password splash page, for security against vandalism.

###TODO:

<li>
add game viewer, eg. forward as well as undo button.</li>
<li>
add write-move directly from the board's position/history (but maybe this isn't necessary)</li>

<li>the delete page is not pretty
</li><li>email moves, or ping the next move</li>
<li>highlight whose turn it is in the database table.</li>
</ul>
