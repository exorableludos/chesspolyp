# Snail Chess || Echesscargot
<img src="https://github.com/polypmer/chesscargot/blob/master/img/play.png?raw=true" width="100px"></img>
<p>chess client using chess.js and <a href="http://chessboardjs.com">chessboard.js</a> and uses PHP/MySql. It is for playing slow games of chess. This code is intended to be loaded onto a server as a private game database where no logins are required; though I'm thinking of adding a simply authentication/password splash page, for security against vandalism. Check out my <a href="http://play.plyp.org">instance</a>, and challenge me at chess.
