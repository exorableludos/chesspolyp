<p>This chess client uses chess.js and <a href="http://chessboardjs.com">chessboard.js</a> and uses PHP/MySql. It is for playing slow games of chess.</p><p> This code is intended to be loaded onto a server as a private game database where no logins are required; though I'm thinking of adding a simply authentication/password splash page, for security against vandalism. Check out my <a href="http://play.plyp.org">instance</a>, and challenge me at chess.
</p>
##Future Features:
<ul>
<li>Add game viewer, eg. forward as well as undo button. (this seems somehow possible).</li>
<li>Integrate status (Black/White to Move - this'll be tricky):</li>
<ul>
<li>Email move, or ping the next mover.</li>
<li>Highlight the player whose turn it is in the database table.</li>
</ul>
<li>Add a comments/guest book feature.</li>
</ul>

###Dependencies:
