<p>This chess client uses chess.js and <a href="http://chessboardjs.com">chessboard.js</a> and uses PHP/MySql. It is for playing slow games of chess. This code is intended to be loaded onto a server as a private game database where no logins are required; though I'm thinking of adding a simply authentication/password splash page, for security against vandalism. Check out my <a href="http://play.plyp.org">instance</a>, and challenge me at chess.
</p>
##Future Features:
<ul>
<li>add game viewer, eg. forward as well as undo button.</li>
<li>email moves, or ping the next move</li>
<li>highlight whose turn it is in the database table.</li>
</ul>

###Dependencies:
Php<br>MySQL<br><a href="https://getskeleton.com">Skeleton css</a> (modified and included)

###Broken:
nothing?
